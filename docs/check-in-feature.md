# Check-in Functionality Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of location-based check-in functionality for challenge requirements in the TravelPoints app.

## Main Features
- Check-in button next to place-specific challenge requirements
- Location verification (within 300 meters of target place)
- Progress tracking for challenge completion
- User feedback with distance information
- Integration with existing check-in system

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `components/ChallengeRequirementItem.tsx` - Added check-in button and location verification
- `app/challenge/[id].tsx` - Updated to pass challenge ID and handle requirement completion
- `helpers/location.helper.ts` - Added location distance calculation utilities
- `constants/Config.ts` - Added configuration for debug mode and check-in radius

### How It Works
1. When a user views a challenge with place-specific requirements, they see a "Check-in" button next to each requirement.
2. When the user taps the button, the system:
   - Gets the user's current location
   - Retrieves the target place's coordinates from the database
   - Calculates the distance between user and place
   - Verifies if the user is within 300 meters of the place
3. If the user is within range:
   - The check-in is recorded in the database
   - The requirement is marked as completed
   - Points are awarded to the user
   - Success message is displayed
4. If the user is out of range:
   - Error message shows how far away they are
   - Option to open maps with directions to the place

### Debug Mode
For testing purposes, there's a debug flag (`DEBUG_BYPASS_LOCATION_CHECK` in `Config.ts`) that can be set to `true` to bypass the location verification.

### API Integration
The implementation leverages the existing `checkinService` for handling check-ins and challenge progress tracking.

## Future Improvements
- Add support for check-in photo requirements
- Implement batch check-in for multiple requirements
- Add map visualization of nearby requirements
- Add offline check-in capability with location verification when back online

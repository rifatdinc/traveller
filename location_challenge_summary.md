# TravelPoints Location-Based Challenge System

## Implementation Summary

The implementation of the location-based challenge system has been completed with the following features:

1. **Dynamic Challenge Generation**
   - Fetches location data from Google Maps API for places near user's location
   - Creates appropriate challenges based on place types
   - Organizes places into categories (culture, nature, gastronomy, etc.)
   - Saves challenges to the database for future users

2. **Requirements System**
   - Each challenge has specific visit requirements
   - Requirements are linked to actual places in the database
   - Places can be viewed on the map and navigated to

3. **User Interface**
   - Challenge details show requirements with places to visit
   - Place details show related challenges
   - Added UI support for location-based filtering
   
4. **Error Handling & Performance**
   - Added retry mechanism for Google API requests
   - Fixed database insertion to avoid duplicates
   - Optimized challenge retrieval
   
5. **Progress Tracking** 
   - Added automatic progress tracking after check-ins
   - Check-in at locations fulfills challenge requirements
   - Proper requirement validation

## Testing
To test the system:
1. Navigate to different locations in the app
2. Check available challenges based on location
3. Visit places and check-in
4. Verify challenge progress is updated

## Future Enhancements
1. Cache frequently visited locations
2. Implement offline support
3. Add social sharing for completed location challenges
4. Implement geofencing for automatic check-ins

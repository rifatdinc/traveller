## Technical Implementation

The application uses:
- React Native with Expo for cross-platform compatibility
- Supabase for backend database and authentication
- React Native Maps for map integration
- Expo Location for user location tracking
- Date-fns for date formatting and calculations

The check-in system follows these steps:
1. User navigates to a place detail screen
2. System checks if the user is within proximity of the place
3. User performs check-in, location is verified
4. System records the check-in, awards points, and updates challenges
5. User's statistics are updated and badges are awarded if applicable

All data is properly secured with row-level security policies to ensure that users can only access their own data.
